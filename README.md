Language: Verilog


//update on Dec, 2, 2022

Special Attention for Possible Admission Committee:

This project is what I mentioned in my CV: Designed a five-stage pipelined MIPS-32 processor in Verilog based on FPGA, and optimized the pipeline structure for acceleration up to a clock speed of 118.5MHz.

You may have a brief view of the pipeline structure
